### **What is it**:
Summon is an Apple-watch app that lets a person summon another person to an exact location within a building. 

### **How does it work**: 
- Bluetooth near-field detection exchange (UUID) between two watches
- CloudKit sends notification to the summoned user (UUID)
- Altimeter detect stair flight change and altitude (Z)
- GPS detects X/Y long/lat coordinates
- Building and room data is provided through a BIM service API
- Through a basic UI, the summoned user is guided to the summoner
- Subtle vibrations let both users know about progression
